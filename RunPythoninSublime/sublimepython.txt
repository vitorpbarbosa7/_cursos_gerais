1: Open Build New System with:
Tools --> Build new system. 
Erase everything in that file and copy those lines below:

{
 "cmd": ["/usr/bin/python3", "$file"],
 "selector": "source.python",
 "file_regex": "file \"(...*?)\", line([0-9]+)"
}

2: Type in terminal:

whereis python 
It will appear something like this:
python: /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python3.8 /usr/lib/python2.7 /usr/lib/python3.8 /etc/python2.7 /etc/python3.8 /usr/local/lib/python2.7 /usr/local/lib/python3.8 /usr/include/python3.8 /usr/share/python /home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python3.7m /home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python3.7-config /home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python3.7m-config /home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python /home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python3.7

if you're using anaconda, (as this one), copy the last path ('/home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python3.7'), cause that is the enviroment you're using to run python (as when you run python directly from shell)

The result will be something like this:
{
 "cmd": ["/home/vitor/anaconda3/bin/python3.7", "$file"],
 "selector": "source.python",
 "file_regex": "file \"(...*?)\", line([0-9]+)"
}

Save this file (Ctrl + S) in the Packages/User folder from SublimeText with the name python (or something similar, as python3, etc.) 

3: Come back to your script, and go to Tools --> Build System --> Select the System you've just created

4: Run the script from that shell you configured using Ctrl+B
